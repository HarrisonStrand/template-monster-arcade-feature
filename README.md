## Description

This project is designed as a arcade game portal for Hubb as part of the virtual event space product. Users can navigate to the arcade main page and choose which game to play to take a break from their company webinars in the virtual space. This project was created with Angular and Typescript with use of p5.js library and Figma and CSS for front end design.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

##### Software Requirements

1. Internet browser
2. A code editor such as VSCode to view and edit the code

##### Open Locally

- Click on the link to my repository: [My Repository](https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/arcade-original-angular)
- Click on the green "Code" button and copy the repository URL
- Open your terminal and use the command `git clone ` into the directory you would like to clone the repository
- Open in text editor to view code and make changes

### Required Scripts

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

Installs all dependancies for the project in order to run the application

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.
Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/arcade-page](http://localhost:4200/arcade-page)

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
